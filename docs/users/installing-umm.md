Derail Valley uses Unity Mod Manager (UMM) for modding.
UMM is a mod loader and modding framework for Unity games.
It is required for all mods to work.


Installing Unity Mod Manager
------------------

1. Download the latest version of UMM.  
   You can get it from [Nexus mods][umm-page].

2. Extract the downloaded archive to a memorable location, such as the desktop.
   Right click the zip file and press "Extract" (do i really need to walk you through how to extract a zip)

3. Open the extracted folder and run UnityModManager.exe.
   If the program does not open, try to install the latest [.Net Framework 4][dotnet-framework]

4. Select Derail Valley from the list of games.
   If game folder is not automatically detected, select it yourself (e.g. \Steam\steamapps\common\YourGame\) (the path should contain only english letters)

5. Click the install button


Installing Mods
--------------------------------

1. Download the mod you want.

2. Open UMM and click on the mods tab.

4. Drag the zip file into the area that says "install mod" or "drag mod here" or whatever it says.

5. Make sure the mod in the list says "installed", else right click it and press install.


Updating and Uninstalling mods

Right click on the mod in the list of mods, then click on either "Update" or "Uninstall"
