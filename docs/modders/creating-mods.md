There are two ways to create a mod, starting with a template or starting from scratch. This guide will go over both of these methods.


From Template
------------------

1.  Go to the [Github Template][template-github] and click "Use this template > Create repository". ![use-template]
    Make sure you have a github account and are signed in.

2.  Clone the repository that was just created to a good location.

3.  Open the sln file and rename 

4.  Every instance of MOD_NAME should be replaced with the name of your mod

5.  Create a file called Directory.Build.targets. Open it in a text editor.

6.


From Scratch
--------------------------------

1. To do, idk why anyone would really want to do it from scratch tbh
